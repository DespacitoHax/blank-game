// IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:

// 1. Game ID
// Choose a unique Game ID. Duplicate IDs may cause conflicts with other games.

// Do NOT use the example ID above. Keep your Game ID confidential at all times.

// 2. Server IP
// Do NOT modify the IP address. It is required to access our services.
// Server migrations may occur occasionally. If that happens, you will be notified, 
// and the IP may need to be updated to maintain connectivity.

// 3. Admin Key
// Use the Admin Key provided when you registered your game via the Hub.
// Keep this key secure. It grants administrative access to your game.
